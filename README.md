<ul>
The home page has four sections to show systematized product information:

<li>Content that supports the customer's knowledge of the area related to the issue of his or her need</li>
<li>Detailed product information</li>
<li>Information on how to use it</li>
</ul>
Each section has a button that allows you to go to the developing page or go directly to placing an order.
<ul>In addition to the standard information functionality, the template also includes a product order section with:
<li>mandatory regulatory approval</li>
<li>a Google Maps plug-in with a store location</li>
<li>the option to choose the delivery method</li>

</ul>

The site also has a contact form supported by the <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/phpmailer/phpmailer">phpmailer</a> package.

By default, the site is set to Polish with default three language versions (Polish, English, Russian).
<br>
The code also includes an administration panel that allows you to manage your orders while fully informing the customer of any change in the status of your order. The administrative panel is accessible from the web page of the administrator login page.
